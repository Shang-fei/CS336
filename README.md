# CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for Stanford's CS336 course - Language Modeling from Scratch.

## Course Overview

CS336 is Stanford's course on building language models from scratch. The course covers:
- Building and training transformer-based language models
- Tokenization (BPE, WordPiece, etc.)
- Training techniques and optimization
- Systems and parallelism for large-scale training
- Data preparation and filtering
- Model alignment and fine-tuning
